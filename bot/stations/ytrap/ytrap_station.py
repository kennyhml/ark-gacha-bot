class YTrapStation(Station):
    """Represents a plant Y-Trap station, the most commonly executed station.
    Like all other stations, it follows the `Station` abstract base class.

    Each station on the tower is represented by a different YTrapStation, which
    allows it to focus on it's own status only. Each station has has it's own
    bed, turning and stack attributes, and its own crop plots that are aware
    of which station they belong to.

    Each `TekCropPlot` represents a singular tek crop plot in the stacks, it is
    not a single reused instance. This allows to keep track of the contents of
    each crop plot and then calculate the total pellet coverage of the station
    at a later point, to decide whether a refill should be initiated.

    Parameters
    -----------
    name :class:`str`:
        The name of the station, or the name of the bed to travel to.

    player :class:`Player`:
        The player instance to handle movements.

    tribelog :class:`Tribelog`:
        The tribelog instance to check tribelogs when spawning.

    info_webhook :class:`InfoWebhook`:
        The info webhook instance to post station statistics to.

    Properties
    ----------
    stacks :class:`str`:
        A nice overview of all the stacks and their crop plots

    pellet_coverage :class:`str`:
        The pellet coverage of the station, for example 40%
